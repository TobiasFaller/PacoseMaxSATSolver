This is going to be the Pacose MaxSAT solver.

To generate a makefile follow the steps indicated below.

build the solver proxy module
mkdir solver-proxy/build && cd solver-proxy/build && cmake .. && make && cd ../..
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

make test <- executes the Regression suite (only the short version)

the long run can be done by switching to MaxSATRegressionSuite and executing 
./run_test.sh ../bin/Pacose [arguments]
