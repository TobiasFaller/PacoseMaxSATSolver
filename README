This is going to be the Pacose MaxSAT solver.

To generate a makefile follow the steps indicated below or execute ./install which does exactly the following steps.

## build the solver proxy module
mkdir solver-proxy/build && cd solver-proxy/build && cmake .. && make -j && cd ../..

## build maxpre2 library
cd maxpre && make lib && cd ..

## finally build Pacose
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j

make test <- executes the Regression suite (only the short version)

the long run can be done by switching to MaxSATRegressionSuite and executing 
./run_test.sh ../bin/Pacose [arguments]
